 * Features
   *    One key feature of a food recipe website is the ability to search for recipes based on various criteria such as ingredients, cuisine type, dietary restrictions, cooking time, and difficulty level. This makes it easier for users to find recipes that match their preferences and needs. Additionally, a good food recipe website may also include user reviews and ratings, recipe collections, nutritional information, and step-by-step cooking instructions with photos or videos. These features can help users make informed decisions about which recipes to try and improve their overall cooking experience.
